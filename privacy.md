# Privacy Policy
This extension does not collect any data in any form.

The details provided in the settings popup are stored
locally only within the Browser.

The only network transmissions that take place are those required
to login (if applicable), create torrent, delete torrent,
and get torrents, from the qBt server you provide.

The only torrents this extension will see from your qBt server, 
are those matching the provided tag in the settings popup.

The extension does capture web requests, but only those
matching `http(s)://<your-qbt-server>/api/*`. This is needed
to correctly communicate with your qBt API as an extension. 

The extension also sends notifications on Torrent add/delete,
as well as any errors that may occur.
